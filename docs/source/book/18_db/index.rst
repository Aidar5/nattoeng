18. Database operations
============================


The use of databases is another way of storing information. Databases are useful not only in storing information. Using the DBMS, it is possible to make information slices according to different parameters.

**Database (DB)** - the data stored according to a certain scheme. This scheme describes relationships between the data.

**DB language (language tools)** - used to describe database structure, manage data (add, edit, delete, receive), manage access rights to the database and its objects, and manage transactions.

**Database Management System (DBMS)** - a software tool that enables the management of the DB. The DBMS must support the appropriate language(s) for the DB management.
